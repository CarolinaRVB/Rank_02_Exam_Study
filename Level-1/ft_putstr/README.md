### ðŸ’¡ Description of solution : (8 lines of code)
--------------------------------
<p> <b>1.</b> Code consists of a function that displays a string in the output. I have included my main to make it easier to test the function itself.</p>
<p> <b>2.</b> To do so i simply have a loop that iterates each character in the string until it finds the "null (\0)" character, present at the end of the string.</p>
<p> <b>3.</b> In each iteration i call the "write" function to write each character.</p>
<p> <b>4.</b> Finally, i write a "newline  (\n)" character in the output and i finish my program. </p>
