### ðŸ’¡ Description of solution : (30 lines of code)
--------------------------------
<p> <b>1.</b> Code consists of a program that takes a string as well as two other characters as parameters, searches in that string, the letter from that third parameter to replace with the fourth paramenter and writes in the output the altered string..</p>
<p> <b>2.</b> To do so i first make sure that the number of arguments is correct (the program + the string + 1st character + 2nd character) and if the third and fourth arguments are composed of only one character as requested. </p>
<p> <b>3.</b> Then, i run a loop to reach the last character of the string. </p>
<p> <b>4.</b> From there, i check if the current character is equal to the character i want to replace, if true i just write my fourth parameter, if not i just write my character. </p>
<p> <b>5.</b> Finally i write a newline character and terminate the program. </p>
