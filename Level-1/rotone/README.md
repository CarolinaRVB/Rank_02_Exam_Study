### ðŸ’¡ Description of solution : (28 lines of code)
--------------------------------
<p> <b>1.</b> Code consists of a program that take a string as a parameter and writes each alphabetical character one position ahead.</p>
<p> <b>2.</b> To do so i first make sure that the number of arguments is correct (the program + the string itself). </p>
<p> <b>3.</b> Then, i run a loop to reach the last character of the string. </p>
<p> <b>4.</b> From there, i have conditions to check if the current character is not an alphabt, if true, i simply write the character. </p>
<p> <b>5.</b> If the character is an alphabetical character, i check if it's either 'z' or 'Z', because if so, then i have to "hard write" the character 'a' or 'A', respectively. </p>
<p> <b>6.</b> If it's any other alphabet, i just write that alphabet one position ahead. </p>
<p> <b>7.</b> Finally at the end i write a newline character and terminate the program. </p>
