### ðŸ’¡ Description of solution : (17 lines of code)
--------------------------------
<p> <b>1.</b> Code consists of a program to obtain the first word of a string passed as a parameter. </p>
<p> <b>2.</b> To do so i first make sure that i have at least two arguments: The compiled program and the string itself. </p>
<p> <b>3.</b> If these conditions are not true, the program should merely write a "newline  (\n)" character and terminate. </p>

<p> <b>4.</b> Next i have the first while loop which will skip any white spaces at the beginning of my string (<b>NOTE:</b> you must include ALL white spaces, not just the usual "space ( )" character.) </p>
<p> <b>5.</b> After i find my first valid character, i use the "write" function to write each character in the output, until i my "i" character is no longer valid, meaning it's either a white space or the string is over.</p>
<p> <b>6.</b> Finally, i write a "newline  (\n)" character in the output and i finish my program, therefore returning only the first word of the passed string. </p>
