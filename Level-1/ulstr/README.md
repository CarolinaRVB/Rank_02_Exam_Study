### ðŸ’¡ Description of solution : (29 lines of code)
--------------------------------
<p> <b>1.</b> Code consists of a program that take a string as a parameter and writes in the output the string with the characters case in reverse.</p>
<p> <b>2.</b> To do so i first make sure that the number of arguments is correct (the program + the string itself). </p>
<p> <b>3.</b> Then, i run a loop to reach the last character of the string. </p>
<p> <b>4.</b> From there, i check if the current character is a big case or small case character, if true i either subtract or add 32 positions to reverse the case. </p>
<p> <b>5.</b> If it's not an alphabet, i just write the character. </p>
<p> <b>6.</b> Finally i write a newline character and terminate the program. </p>
